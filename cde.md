# CDE 2026

CDE (Cyber Defense Exercise) is a red/blue team competition held annually by the UMBC CyberDawgs club, open to all students. Whether you're a seasoned expert or started using a password manager yesterday, competing in CDE is a great way to learn and stay sharp.

Teams of up to 4 are allowed, and you can plan them ahead of time or find teammates the day of. Signups will open closer to the event.
