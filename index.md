## <a name="meetings">Meetings

We hold general meetings once a week. **No prior experience** is required to
attend our meetings. We encourage anyone who wants to learn more about cyber
security and how to start learning new skills in the field to come to our
meetings.

**What to expect from a meeting:**

* An environment conducive to learning relevant cybersecurity tools and
techniques
* A place to meet like-minded students and discuss all things cyber security 


Our meetings vary in subject material week to week. If you have specific topics
you would like to learn more about please email our club secretary. If you
would like to present a talk or teach a new skill please email our club
president.

### Fall Semester Meetings

If you're new, no worries, you can still come; talk to us to see to what extent you might need to 
catch yourself up. Security's nowhere near as hard as people say, so don't be scared away :)

This fall we will go in depth in similar topics to past years, previous topics include reverse
engineering and exploitation. See our calendar below for details.

## Planned Projects and Activities

Along with our normal club meetings, we also provide great opportunities for
individuals who are interested in learning about and participating in cyber
related competitions. Here's what we're doing this year:

* Hosting a CTF (Capture the Flag) event at UMBC. It'll be accessible to
beginners, but entertaining for all. We did this last year, and we're all
looking forward to it. Sign up [here](https://forms.gle/V3sezPc6i9pqcG1f9).

* We are running our 4th Annual Cyber Defense Exercise (CDE) in Fall of 2020 in PUP 105. CDE is a miniature version of our biggest competition for the year CCDC. It is open to all UMBC undergrads and is a great opportunity to learn more about network security and Cyber Security competitions. If you're interested in joining our CCDC team, we strongly recommend participating so you can get a taste of the competition and show us where you may fit in. Mark your calendars!! 

* Competing in the following competitions:
    * [DoE Cyberforce](https://cyberforcecompetition.com/) (Fall)
    * CSAW 2019
    * UMD CSEC's CTF
    * MACCDC 2020
    * Kaizen CTF
    * Probably some others

However, if these are all going to come to fruition, we need your help to
make it happen! We have a myriad of tasks and projects that will need to be done
over the next year, so stay tuned...
