## Current Board

## <a name="meetings"/> Meetings

We hold general meetings once a week. **No prior experience** is required to
attend our meetings. We encourage anyone who wants to learn more about cyber
security and how to start learning new skills in the field to come to our
meetings.

**What to expect from a meeting:**

* An environment conducive to learning relevant cybersecurity tools and
techniques
* A place to meet like minded students and discuss all things cyber security 


Our meetings vary in subject material week to week. If you have specific topics
you would like to learn more about please email our club secretary. If you
would like to present a talk or teach a new skill please email our club
president.

## Upcoming Projects and Activities

Along with our normal club meetings, we also provides great opportunities
for individuals who are interested in learning about and participating in
cyber related competitions. This upcoming school year, we want to take this a
step further with some new initiatives that are currently in the works. These
include, but are not limited to:

* Hosting our own cyber CTF (Capture the Flag) event at UMBC
* Getting a coach for this year's CCDC team
* Increasing collaborative and promotional efforts with other UMBC organizations
* Providing a comprehensive list of resources for various cyber security related topics

However, if these are all going to come to fruition, we need your help to
make it happen! We have a myriad of tasks and projects that will need to be done
over the next year, so stay tuned...
