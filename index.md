## <a name="meetings">Meetings

We hold general meetings once a week. **No prior experience** is required to
attend our meetings. We encourage anyone who wants to learn more about cyber
security and how to start learning new skills in the field to come to our
meetings.

**What to expect from a meeting:**

* An environment conducive to learning relevant cybersecurity tools and
techniques
* A place to meet like-minded students and discuss all things cyber security 


Our meetings vary in subject material week to week. If you have specific topics
you would like to learn more about please email our club secretary. If you
would like to present a talk or teach a new skill please email our club
president.

### Fall Semester Meetings

Our meetings for the fall semester are an introduction to computer security. We
will go over many of the foundational topics in computer security, so if you're
a beginner, you're in luck.

If you already have experience, don't worry-you'll be able to meet like-minded
folks, and we will have plenty of more challenging activities available.

Our meetings for the spring semester will likely continue with that trend, but
we will go more in depth. Previous spring topics include reverse engineering and
cryptography. We will discuss plans at the end of the fall semester.

## Planned Projects and Activities

Along with our normal club meetings, we also provide great opportunities for
individuals who are interested in learning about and participating in cyber
related competitions. Here's what we're doing this semester:

* Hosting a CTF (Capture the Flag) event at UMBC. It'll be accessible to
  beginners, but entertaining for all. We did this last year, and we're all
  looking forward to it. See details at the top of the page.

* Competing in the following competitions:
    * [CCDC (Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition)](http://maccdc.org/) (Spring)
    * We are running our 2nd Annual Cyber Defense Exercise (CDE) on October 20th, 2018 in PUP 105. CDE is a miniature version of our biggest competition for the year CCDC. It is open to all UMBC undergrads and is a great opportunity to learn more about network security and Cyber Security competitions. If you're interested in joining our CCDC team, we strongly recommend participating so you can get a taste of the competition and show us where you may fit in. Mark your calendars!! 
    * ISTS
    * UMD CSEC's CTF
    * CSAW 2018
    * Kaizen CTF
    * Probably some others

However, if these are all going to come to fruition, we need your help to
make it happen! We have a myriad of tasks and projects that will need to be done
over the next year, so stay tuned...
