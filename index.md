## <a name="meetings">Meetings

We hold general club meetings every Monday from 7:10pm to 9pm in ENG 231.
We encourage anyone who wants to learn more about cyber security and how to develop 
skills in the field to come to our meetings. If you’re 
new to cyber or computing security, no worries, you can still come. 
Security’s nowhere near as hard as people say, so don’t be scared away :)

No prior experience is required to attend or participate in our meetings. 

**What To Expect From A Meeting:**

* An environment conducive to learning relevant tools and techniques
* A place to meet like-minded students and discuss all things cyber and computing security

Our meetings vary in subject material from week to week. If you have specific topics
you would like to learn more about, please email our club secretary. If you
would like to present a talk or teach a new skill, please email our club
president.

## Club Events

Along with our normal club meetings, we also provide great opportunities for
individuals who are interested in learning about and participating in cyber
related competitions. Here's what we're doing:

* We host two CTF (Capture the Flag) events at UMBC every year: 
   * **DawgCTF** Open to all UMBC students of all skill levels. Held during the Spring semester.
    * **CyberPaws CTF** Open to our club members; aimed at beginners. Held during Fall semester.

* We host a **Cyber Defense Exercise (CDE)** each Fall. CDE is a Red/Blue cyber defense exercise. It is open to all UMBC undergrads and is a great opportunity to learn more about cyber security and cyber competitions. We strongly recommend participating so you can get a taste of the competition environment, in case you'd like to try out for the team.

* Finally, we host an **End-of-Semester Celebration**, each Spring and Fall, for all UMBC students to attend and take a break before exams. We provide pizza, drinks, and candy as well as music and games. We also announce winners of our CTFs and hand out prizes!
