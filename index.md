## <a name="meetings">Meetings</a>

We hold general meetings once a week. **No prior experience** is required to
attend our meetings. We encourage anyone who wants to learn more about cyber
security and how to start learning new skills in the field to come to our
meetings.

**What to expect from a meeting:**

* An environment conducive to learning relevant cybersecurity tools and
techniques
* A place to meet like-minded students and discuss all things cyber security 


Our meetings vary in subject material week to week. If you have specific topics
you would like to learn more about please email our club secretary. If you
would like to present a talk or teach a new skill please email our club
president.

### Fall Semester Meetings

Our meetings for the fall semester are an introduction to computer security. We
will go over many of the foundational topics in computer security, so if you're
a beginner, you're in luck.

If you already have experience, don't worry-you'll be able to meet like-minded
folks, and we will have plenty of more challenging activities available.

Our meetings for the spring semester will likely continue with that trend, but
we will go more in depth. Previous spring topics include reverse engineering and
cryptography. We will discuss plans at the end of the fall semester.

For a full description of our schedule, take a look at the calendar below.

## Planned Projects and Activities

Along with our normal club meetings, we also provide great opportunities for
individuals who are interested in learning about and participating in cyber
related competitions. This upcoming school year, we want to take this a step
further with some new initiatives that are currently in the works. These
include, but are not limited to:

* Running a miniature defense competition for both fun and preparation for CCDC.
  It'll be open to all UMBC undergrads at minimum. We'll likely also have a
  couple invited teams. Mark your calendars for **October 28, 2017**. More
  details to come.

* Hosting a CTF (Capture the Flag) event at UMBC. It'll be accessible to
  beginners, but entertaining for all. We did this last year, and we're all
  looking forward to it. More details to come.

* Competing in the following competitions:
    * Booz Allen Hamilton's Kaizen CTF (fall).
    * [CSAW CTF](https://csaw.engineering.nyu.edu/ctf)
      (moderate level, not recommended for beginners) (fall)
    * [CCDC (Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition)](http://maccdc.org/) (Spring)
    * [ISTS](https://ists.sparsa.org/), hosted by SPARSA at RIT (Spring)
    * [Metropolis](https://www.cyberskyline.com/events/metropolis) (Spring)

* Increasing collaborative and promotional efforts with other UMBC organizations

However, if these are all going to come to fruition, we need your help to
make it happen! We have a myriad of tasks and projects that will need to be done
over the next year, so stay tuned...
