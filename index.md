## <a name="meetings"/> Meetings

We hold general meetings once a week. **No prior experience** is required to
attend our meetings. We encourage anyone who wants to learn more about cyber
security and how to start learning new skills in the field to come to our
meetings.

**What to expect from a meeting:**

* An environment conducive to learning relevant cybersecurity tools and
techniques
* A place to meet like-minded students and discuss all things cyber security 


Our meetings vary in subject material week to week. If you have specific topics
you would like to learn more about please email our club secretary. If you
would like to present a talk or teach a new skill please email our club
president.

### Fall Semester Meetings

Our meetings for the fall semester are sort of an introduction to computer
security. We aim to go over many of the foundational topics in computer
security, so if you're a beginner, you won't want to miss a meeting.

If you already have experience, don't worry-you'll be able to meet like-minded folks,
and we will have plenty of more challenging activities available.

For a full description of our schedule, take a look at the calendar below.

## Planned Projects and Activities

Along with our normal club meetings, we also provide great opportunities for
individuals who are interested in learning about and participating in cyber
related competitions. This upcoming school year, we want to take this a step
further with some new initiatives that are currently in the works. These
include, but are not limited to:

* Hosting our own CTF (Capture the Flag) event at UMBC. It'll be accessible to
beginners, but entertaining for all. Mark your calendars for **March 4, 2017**.
More details to come.

* Competing in the following competitions:
    * [CCDC (Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition)](http://maccdc.org/) (Spring)
    * [CSAW CTF](https://csaw.engineering.nyu.edu/ctf)
      (moderate level, not recommended for beginners) (fall)
    * [MITRE CTF](https://www.mitre.org/news/corporate-events/capture-the-flag-ctf-2016)
      (easier than CSAW, same weekend)
    * Booz Allen Hamilton's Kaizen CTF (fall). Details will be coming.

* Working with our CCDC coach, Dr. Mike Oehler, to improve our skills for the
CCDC competition

* Finding another CCDC coach with skills that complement our current coach's
skills.

* Increasing collaborative and promotional efforts with other UMBC organizations

* Providing a comprehensive list of resources for various cyber security related topics

* Developing a curriculum for a planned "active cyber defense" course.

However, if these are all going to come to fruition, we need your help to
make it happen! We have a myriad of tasks and projects that will need to be done
over the next year, so stay tuned...
