## <a name="meetings">Meetings

We hold general club meetings every Monday from 7:10pm to 9pm in ENG 231.
We encourage anyone who wants to learn more about cyber security and how to 
start learning new skills in the field to come to our meetings. If you’re 
new to cyber or computing security, no worries, you can still come. 
Security’s nowhere near as hard as people say, so don’t be scared away :)

No prior experience is required to attend or participate in our meetings. 

**What To Expect From A Meeting:**

* An environment conducive to learning relevant tools and techniques
* A place to meet like-minded students and discuss all things cyber and computing security

Our meetings vary in subject material week to week. If you have specific topics
you would like to learn more about please email our club secretary. If you
would like to present a talk or teach a new skill please email our club
president.

## Club Events

Along with our normal club meetings, we also provide great opportunities for
individuals who are interested in learning about and participating in cyber
related competitions. Here's what we're doing:

* We host a CTF (Capture the Flag) event at UMBC every year: DawgCTF
    * Held during the Spring semester
    * Open to everyone of all skill levels

* We host another CTF, called CyberPaws, that has weekly challenges meant more for beginner

* We are running our 6th Annual Cyber Defense Exercise (CDE) in Fall 2023. CDE is a miniature version of our biggest competition for the year CCDC. It is open to all UMBC undergrads and is a great opportunity to learn more about network security and Cyber Security competitions. If you're interested in joining our CCDC team, we strongly recommend participating so you can get a taste of the competition and show us where you may fit in. Mark your calendars!! 

* Finally, we host an end of semester celebration for all to attend
