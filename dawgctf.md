# DawgCTF 2020

The [UMBC Cyber Dawgs](http://umbccd.umbc.edu/) are hosting our second annual CTF on Saturday, April 11. 
If we are able to hold this event in-person, doors will open 9ish for setup and food.

Registration is required, please fill out the [registration form](https://umbccd.io/). 
Each team member must register individually, you can form teams when you get here.

DawgCTF will be a Jeopardy style CTF open to all undergraduate college students (we might allow some grad students, talk to us). 
It will be held in the UMBC University Center Ballroom. 
Breakfast and lunch will be provided.

This will be a team competition. 
The maximum team size is 4, but you can play by yourself ifyou want.

Prizes have been picked up, though can only be rewarded to those part of the "in-person" portion of this event.

Our goal is to have this CTF be fun and accessible for CTF beginners and veterans alike. 
If you're a beginner, you'll want to have some computer security knowledge. 
CTF veterans will have lots of fun with our harder challenges.

We will have challenges in the following areas: Crypto, RE, Pwn, Web, Misc, and whatever else we feel like creating!

If you have questions, please contact our president Anna Staats (her email can be found on the webpage linked above.
