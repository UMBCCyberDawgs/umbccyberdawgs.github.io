# DawgCTF 2018

The [UMBC Cyber Dawgs](http://umbccd.umbc.edu/) are hosting our second annual
CTF on Sunday, March 11 from 11am-7pm.

Registration is required. 

DawgCTF will be a Jeopardy style CTF open to all undergraduate college students
(we might allow some grad students, talk to us). It will be held in the UMBC
University Center Ballroom. Breakfast and lunch will be provided.

This will be a team competition. Team size is 4, but you can play by yourself if
you want.

Prizes: will be a thing, we haven't decided exactly what yet. Last year we gave
out prizes such as the IDA Pro book, Raspberry Pis, WiFi Pineapples, etc.

Our goal is to have this CTF be fun and accessible for CTF beginners and
veterans alike. If you're a beginner, you'll want to have some computer security
knowledge. CTF veterans will have lots of fun with our harder challenges.

We will have challenges in the following areas: Crypto, RE, Pwn, Web, Misc, and
whatever else we feel like creating!

If you have questions, please contact our vice president Chris Gardner (his
email can be found on the webpage linked above.
