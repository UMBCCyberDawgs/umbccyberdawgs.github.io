# DawgCTF 2026

DawgCTF is a Jeopardy-style CTF hosted annual by the CyberDawgs club, open to club members in person and online to anyone.

This year DawgCTF will be from April 10-12.

You can register and form teams on [MetaCTF](https://metactf.com/join/dawgctf26). 

To stay up-to-date on developments you can join the [DawgCTF Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NTJaCuaUTm).

Prizes will be given to the best competitors of the in-person event.

Our goal is to have this CTF be fun and accessible for CTF beginners and veterans alike with challenges across catagories and skill levels.


If you have questions, please ask in the Discord or by emailing a board member.
